## Supported PHP Versions

This library supports the following PHP versions:

* PHP 7.1
* PHP 7.2
* PHP 7.3
* PHP 7.4
* PHP 8.0
* PHP 8.1

## Stark Infra API documentation

Feel free to take a look at our [API docs](https://www.starkinfra.com/docs/api).

## Versioning

This project adheres to the following versioning pattern:

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment:

- MAJOR version when the **API** version is incremented. This may include backwards incompatible changes;
- MINOR version when **breaking changes** are introduced OR **new functionalities** are added in a backwards compatible manner;
- PATCH version when backwards compatible bug **fixes** are implemented.

# Setup

## 1. Install our SDK

### 1. Install our SDK

1.1 Composer: To install the package with Composer, run:

```sh
composer require starkinfra/sdk
```

To use the bindings, use following the command:

```sh
require_once('vendor/starkinfra/sdk/src/init.php');
```

1.2 Manual installation: You can also download the latest release from GitHub and then, to use the bindings, include the init.php file.

```sh
require_once('/path/to/starkinfra/sdk-php/src/init.php');
```

## 2. Create your Private and Public Keys

We use ECDSA. That means you need to generate a secp256k1 private
key to sign your requests to our API, and register your public key
with us, so we can validate those requests.

You can use one of following methods:

2.1. Check out the options in our [tutorial](https://starkbank.com/faq/how-to-create-ecdsa-keys).

2.2. Use our SDK:

```php
use StarkInfra;

list($privateKey, $publicKey) = StarkInfra\Key::create();

# or, to also save .pem files in a specific path
list($privateKey, $publicKey) = StarkInfra\Key::create("file/keys/");
```

**NOTE**: When you are creating new credentials, it is recommended that you create the
keys inside the infrastructure that will use it, in order to avoid risky internet
transmissions of your **private-key**. Then you can export the **public-key** alone to the
computer where it will be used in the new Project creation.

## 3. Register your user credentials

You can interact directly with our API using two types of users: Projects and Organizations.

- **Projects** are workspace-specific users, that is, they are bound to the workspaces they are created in.
One workspace can have multiple Projects.
- **Organizations** are general users that control your entire organization.
They can control all your Workspaces and even create new ones. The Organization is bound to your company's tax ID only.
Since this user is unique in your entire organization, only one credential can be linked to it.

3.1. To create a Project in Sandbox:

3.1.1. Log into [Starkinfra Sandbox](https://web.sandbox.starkinfra.com)

3.1.2. Go to Menu > Integrations

3.1.3. Click on the "New Project" button

3.1.4. Create a Project: Give it a name and upload the public key you created in section 2

3.1.5. After creating the Project, get its Project ID

3.1.6. Use the Project ID and private key to create the object below:

```php
use StarkInfra;

// Get your private key from an environment variable or an encrypted database.
// This is only an example of a private key content. You should use your own key.
$privateKeyContent = "
-----BEGIN EC PARAMETERS-----
BgUrgQQACg==
-----END EC PARAMETERS-----
-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
MHQCAQEEIMCwW74H6egQkTiz87WDvLNm7fK/cA+ctA2vg/bbHx3woAcGBSuBBAAK
oUQDQgAE0iaeEHEgr3oTbCfh8U2L+r7zoaeOX964xaAnND5jATGpD/tHec6Oe9U1
IF16ZoTVt1FzZ8WkYQ3XomRD4HS13A==
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
";

$project = new StarkInfra\Project([
    "environment" => "sandbox",
    "id" => "5656565656565656",
    "privateKey" => $privateKeyContent
]);
```

3.2. To create Organization credentials in Sandbox:

3.2.1. Log into [Starkinfra Sandbox](https://web.sandbox.starkinfra.com)

3.2.2. Go to Menu > Integrations

3.2.3. Click on the "Organization public key" button

3.2.4. Upload the public key you created in section 2 (only a legal representative of the organization can upload the public key)

3.2.5. Click on your profile picture and then on the "Organization" menu to get the Organization ID

3.2.6. Use the Organization ID and private key to create the object below:

```php
use StarkInfra;

// Get your private key from an environment variable or an encrypted database.
// This is only an example of a private key content. You should use your own key.
$privateKeyContent = "
-----BEGIN EC PARAMETERS-----
BgUrgQQACg==
-----END EC PARAMETERS-----
-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
MHQCAQEEIMCwW74H6egQkTiz87WDvLNm7fK/cA+ctA2vg/bbHx3woAcGBSuBBAAK
oUQDQgAE0iaeEHEgr3oTbCfh8U2L+r7zoaeOX964xaAnND5jATGpD/tHec6Oe9U1
IF16ZoTVt1FzZ8WkYQ3XomRD4HS13A==
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
";

$organization = new StarkInfra\Organization([
    "environment" => "sandbox",
    "id" => "5656565656565656",
    "privateKey" => $privateKeyContent,
    "workspaceId" => null // You only need to set the workspaceId when you are operating a specific workspaceId
]);

// To dynamically use your organization credentials in a specific workspaceId,
// you can use the Organization::replace() method:
$balance = StarkInfra\IssuingBalance::get(StarkInfra\Organization::replace($organization, "4848484848484848"));
```

NOTE 1: Never hard-code your private key. Get it from an environment variable or an encrypted database.

NOTE 2: We support `'sandbox'` and `'production'` as environments.

NOTE 3: The credentials you registered in `sandbox` do not exist in `production` and vice versa.


## 4. Setting up the user

There are three kinds of users that can access our API: **Organization**, **Project** and **Member**.

- `Project` and `Organization` are designed for integrations and are the ones meant for our SDKs.
- `Member` is the one you use when you log into our webpage with your e-mail.

There are two ways to inform the user to the SDK:

4.1 Passing the user as argument in all functions:

```php
use StarkInfra;

$balance = StarkInfra\IssuingBalance::get($project);  # or organization
```

4.2 Set it as a default user in the SDK:

```php
use StarkInfra;

StarkInfra\Settings::setUser($project);  # or organization

$balance = StarkInfra\IssuingBalance::get();  # or organization
```

Just select the way of passing the user that is more convenient to you.
On all following examples we will assume a default user has been set.

## 5. Setting up the error language

The error language can also be set in the same way as the default user:

```php
use StarkInfra;

StarkInfra\Settings::setLanguage("en-US");
```

Language options are "en-US" for english and "pt-BR" for brazilian portuguese. English is default.

# Resource listing and manual pagination

Almost all SDK resources provide a `query` and a `page` function.

- The `query` function provides a straight forward way to efficiently iterate through all results that match the filters you inform,
seamlessly retrieving the next batch of elements from the API only when you reach the end of the current batch.
If you are not worried about data volume or processing time, this is the way to go.

```php
use StarkInfra;

$transactions = StarkInfra\IssuingTransaction::query([
    "after" => "2020-01-01",
    "before" => "2020-03-01"
]);

foreach ($transactions as $transaction) {
    print_r($transaction);
}
```

- The `page` function gives you full control over the API pagination. With each function call, you receive up to
100 results and the cursor to retrieve the next batch of elements. This allows you to stop your queries and
pick up from where you left off whenever it is convenient. When there are no more elements to be retrieved, the returned cursor will be `null`.

```php
use StarkInfra;

$cursor = null;
while (true) { 
    list($page, $cursor) = StarkInfra\IssuingTransaction::page($options = ["limit" => 5, "cursor" => $cursor]);
    foreach ($page as $transaction) {
        print_r($transaction);
    }
    if ($cursor == null) {
        break;
    }
}
```

To simplify the following SDK examples, we will only use the `query` function, but feel free to use `page` instead.

# Testing in Sandbox

Your initial balance is zero. For many operations in Stark Infra, you'll need funds
in your account, which can be added to your balance by creating an starkbank.Invoice. 

In the Sandbox environment, most of the created starkbank.Invoices will be automatically paid,
so there's nothing else you need to do to add funds to your account. Just create
a few starkbank.Invoices and wait around a bit.

In Production, you (or one of your clients) will need to actually pay this starkbank.Invoice
for the value to be credited to your account.


# Usage

## Issuing

### Query Issuing Products

To take a look at the sub-issuer card products available to you, just run the following:

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingProduct;

$products = IssuingProduct::query();

foreach ($products as $product) {
    print_r($product);
}
```

### Create Issuing Holders

You can create card holders to your Workspace.

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingHolder;

$holders = IssuingHolder::create([
    new IssuingHolder([
        "name" => "Iron Bank S.A.",
        "taxId" => "012.345.678-90",
        "externalId" => "1234",
        "tags" => [
            "Traveler Employee"
        ],
        "rules" => [
            new StarkInfra\IssuingRule([
                "name" => "General USD",
                "interval" => "day",
                "amount" => 100000,
                "currencyCode" => "USD"
            ])
        ]
    ]),
]);

foreach ($holders as $holder) {
    print_r($holder);
```

**Note**: Instead of using IssuingHolder objects, you can also pass each transfer element in dictionary format

### Query Issuing Holders

You can query multiple holders according to filters.

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingHolder;

$holders = IssuingHolder::query();

foreach ($holders as $holder) {
    print_r($holder);

use StarkInfra\IssuingHolder;

$holder = IssuingHolder::cancel("5155165527080960");

print_r($holder);
```

### Get an Issuing Holder

To get a single Issuing Holder by its id, run:

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingHolder;

```

### Query Issuing Holder logs

You can query holder logs to better understand holder life cycles.

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingHolder;

$logs = IssuingHolder\Log::query(["limit" => 50]);

foreach ($logs as $log) {
    print_r($log);
}
```

use StarkInfra\\IssuingHolder;

$log = IssuingHolder\Log::get("5155165527080960");

print_r($log);
```

### Create Issuing Cards

You can issue cards with specific spending rules to make purchases.

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingCard;

$cards = IssuingCard::create([
    new IssuingCard([
        "holdeNname" => "Developers",
        "holderTaxId" => "012.345.678-90",
        "holderExternalId" => "1234",
        "rules" => [
            new StarkInfra\IssuingRule([
                "name" => "general",
                "interval" => "week",
                "amount" => 50000,
                "currencyCode" => "USD"
            ])
        ]
    ]),
]);

foreach ($cards as $card) {
    print_r($card);
```

print_r($card);
```

### Update an Issuing Card

You can update a specific Issuing Card by its id.

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingCard;

$card = IssuingCard::update("5155165527080960", ["status" => "blocked"]);

print_r($card);
```

### Cancel an Issuing Card

You can also cancel a card by its id.
Note that this is not possible if it has been processed already.

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingCard;

$card = IssuingCard::cancel("5155165527080960");

print_r($card);
```

### Query Issuing Card logs

Logs are pretty important to understand the life cycle of a card.

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingCard;

$logs = IssuingCard\Log::query(["limit" => 150]);

foreach ($logs as $log) {
    print_r($log);
```

### Get an Issuing Card log

You can get a single log by its id.

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingCard;

$log = IssuingCard\Log::get("5155165527080960");

print_r($log);
```

## Process an Issuing Purchase authorization

It's easy to process an IssuingPurchase authorization that arrived in your registered URL. 
Remember to pass the signature header so the SDK can make sure it's StarkInfra that sent you 
the request. If you do not approve or decline the authorization within 2 seconds, 
the authorization will be denied.

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingPurchase;

$request = listen();  # this is your handler to listen for authorization requests

$purchase = IssuingPurchase::parse(
    $request->content, 
    $request->headers["Digital-Signature"]
);

# after parsing you should analyse the authorization request and then respond

# To approve:
sendResponse(  # you should also implement this method to respond the read request
    IssuingPurchase::response([
        "status" => "approved",
    ]);
);

# To deny:
sendResponse(  # you should also implement this method to respond the read request
    IssuingPurchase::response([
        "status" => "denied",
        "reason" => "stolenCard",
    ]);
);
```

### Query Issuing Purchases

You can get a list of created purchases given some filters.

use StarkInfra\IssuingPurchase;

$purchases = IssuingPurchase::query([
    "after" => "2020-01-01",
    "before" => "2020-03-01"
]);

foreach ($purchases as $purchase) {
    print_r($purchase);
}
```

### Get an Issuing Purchase

After its creation, information on a purchase may be retrieved by its id. 

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingPurchase;

$log = IssuingPurchase::get("5155165527080960");

print_r($log);
```

### Query Issuing Purchase logs

Logs are pretty important to understand the life cycle of a purchase.

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingPurchase;

$logs = IssuingPurchase\Log::query(["limit" => 150]);

    print_r($log);
}
```

### Get an Issuing Purchase log

You can get a single log by its id.

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingPurchases;

$log = IssuingPurchase\Log::get("5155165527080960");

print_r($log);
```

### Create Issuing Invoices

You can create Pix invoices to transfer money from accounts you have in any bank to your Issuing balance, allowing you to run your issuing operation.

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingInvoice;

$invoices = IssuingInvoice::create(
    new IssuingInvoice([
        "amount" => 1000
    ])
);

foreach ($invoices as $invoice) {
    print_r($invoice);
}
```

**Note**: Instead of using Invoice objects, you can also pass each invoice element in dictionary format

### Get an Issuing Invoice

After its creation, information on an invoice may be retrieved by its id. 
Its status indicates whether it's been paid.

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingInvoice;

$invoice = IssuingInvoice::get("5155165527080960");

print_r($invoice);
```

### Query Issuing Invoices

You can get a list of created invoices given some filters.

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingInvoice;

$invoices = IssuingInvoice::query();

foreach ($invoices as $invoice) {
    print_r($invoice);
```

### Query Issuing Invoice logs

Logs are pretty important to understand the life cycle of an invoice.

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingInvoice;

$logs = IssuingInvoice\Log::query(["limit" => 150]);

foreach ($logs as $log) {
    print_r($log);
```

### Create Issuing Withdrawals

You can create withdrawals to send back cash to your Banking account by using the Withdrawal resource

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingWithdrawal;

$withdrawals = IssuingWithdrawal::create(
    new IssuingWithdrawal([
        "amount" => 10000.
        "externalId" => "123",
        "description" => "Sending back"
    ])
);

foreach ($withdrawals as $withdrawal) {
    print_r($withdrawal);
}
```

**Note**: Instead of using Withdrawal objects, you can also pass each withdrawal element in dictionary format

### Get an Issuing Withdrawal

After its creation, information on a withdrawal may be retrieved by its id.

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingWithdrawal;

$withdrawal = IssuingWithdrawal::get("5155165527080960");

print_r($withdrawal);
```

### Query Issuing Withdrawals

You can get a list of created invoices given some filters.

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingWithdrawal;

$withdrawals = IssuingWithdrawal::query();

foreach ($withdrawals as $withdrawal) {
    print_r($withdrawal);
}
```

**Note**: the Organization user can only update a workspace with the Workspace ID set.

### Query Issuing Transactions

To understand your balance changes (issuing statement), you can query
transactions. Note that our system creates transactions for you when
you make purchases, withdrawals, receive issuing invoice payments, for example.

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingTransaction;

$transactions = IssuingTransaction::query([
    "after" => "2020-01-01",
    "before" => "2020-03-01"
]);

foreach ($transactions as $transaction) {
    print_r($transaction);
}
```

### Get an Issuing Transaction

You can get a specific transaction by its id:

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingTransaction;

$transaction = IssuingTransaction::get("5155165527080960");

print_r($transaction);
```

### Get Issuing Balance

To know how much money you have in your workspace, run:

```php
use StarkInfra\IssuingBalance;

$balance = IssuingBalance::get();

print_r($balance);
```

### Issuing Enums

#### Query MerchantCategories

You can query any merchant categories using this resource.
You may also use MerchantCategories to define specific category filters in IssuingRules.
Either codes (which represents specific MCCs) or types (code groups) will be accepted as filters.

```php
use StarkInfra\MerchantCategory;

$categories = MerchantCategory::query([
    "search" => "food"
]);

foreach ($categories as $category) {
    print_r($category);
}
```

#### Query MerchantCountries

You can query any merchant countries using this resource.
You may also use MerchantCountries to define specific country filters in IssuingRules.

```php
use StarkInfra\MerchantCountry;

$countries = MerchantCountry::query([
    "search" => "brazil"
]);

foreach ($countries as $country) {
    print_r($country);
}
```

#### Query CardMethods

You can query available card methods using this resource.
You may also use CardMethods to define specific purchase method filters in IssuingRules.

```php
use StarkInfra\CardMethod;

$methods = CardMethod::query([
    "search" => "token"
]);

foreach ($methods as $method) {
    print_r($method);
}
```

## Pix

## Create PixRequests
You can create Pix Requests to charge a user:

```php
use StarkInfra\PixRequest;
use StarkInfra\Utils\EndToEndId;

$requests = PixRequest::create([
    new PixRequest([
        "amount" => 1000,
        "externalId" => "my-external-id:1",
        "senderAccountNumber" => "76543-8",
        "senderBranchCode" => "2201",
        "senderAccountType" => "checking",
        "senderName" => "Tony Stark",
        "senderTaxId" => "594.739.480-42",
        "receiverBankCode" => "341",
        "receiverAccountNumber" => "00000-0",
        "receiverBranchCode" => "0001",
        "receiverAccountType" => "checking",
        "receiverName" => "Daenerys Targaryen Stormborn",
        "receiverTaxId" => "012.345.678-90",
        "endToEndId" => EndToEndId::create("20018183"),
    ]),
    new PixRequest([
        "amount" => 200,
        "externalId" => "my-external-id:2",
        "senderAccountNumber" => "76543-8",

        "senderAccountType" => "checking",
        "senderName" => "Tony Stark",
        "senderTaxId" => "594.739.480-42",
        "receiverBankCode" => "341",
        "receiverAccountNumber" => "00000-0",
        "receiverBranchCode" => "0001",
        "receiverAccountType" => "checking",
        "receiverName" => "Daenerys Targaryen Stormborn",
        "receiverTaxId" => "012.345.678-90",
        "endToEndId" => EndToEndId::create("20018183"),
    ]);
]);

foreach($requests as $request){
    print_r($request);
}
```

**Note**: Instead of using Pix Request objects, you can also pass each transaction element in dictionary format

## Query PixRequests

You can query multiple Pix Requests according to filters.

```php
use StarkInfra\PixRequest;

$requests = PixRequest::query([
    "fields" => ['amount', 'senderName'],
    "limit" => 10,
    "after" => "2020-04-01",
    "before" => "2020-04-30",
    "status" => "success",
    "tags" => ['iron', 'suit'],
    "endToEndIds" => ['E79457883202101262140HHX553UPqeq'],
]);

foreach($requests as $request){
    print_r($request);
}
```

## Get a PixRequest

After its creation, information on a Pix Request may be retrieved by its id. Its status indicates whether it has been paid.

## Process PixRequest authorization requests

It's easy to process authorization requests that arrived in your handler. Remember to pass the
signature header so the SDK can make sure it's StarkInfra that sent you
the event.

```php
use StarkInfra\PixRequest;

$request = listen();  # this is your handler to listen for authorization requests

$request = PixRequest::parse(
    $request->content, 
    $request->headers["Digital-Signature"]
);

# after parsing you should analyse the authorization request and then respond

# To approve:
sendResponse(  # you should also implement this method to respond the read request
    PixRequest::response([
        "status" => "approved",
    ]);
);

# To deny:
sendResponse(  # you should also implement this method to respond the read request
    PixRequest::response([
        "status" => "denied",
        "reason" => "invalidAccountNumber",
    ]);
);
```

StaticBrcodes store account information via a QR code or an image 
that represents a PixKey and a few extra fixed parameters, such as 
an amount and a reconciliation ID. They can easily be used to 
receive Pix transactions.

```php
use StarkInfra\StaticBrcode;

$brcodes = StaticBrcode::create([
    new StaticBrcode([
        "name" => "Jamie Lannister",
        "keyId" => "+5511988887777",

BR codes store information represented by Pix QR Codes, which are used to send or receive Pix transactions in a convenient way.
DynamicBrcodes represent charges with information that can change at any time, since all 
data needed for the payment is requested dynamically to your registered URL.

```php
use StarkInfra\DynamicBrcode;

$brcodes = DynamicBrcode::create([
    new DynamicBrcode([
        "name" => "Jamie Lannister",
        "city" =>"Rio de Janeiro"
        "externalId" => "my_unique_id",

print_r($brcode);
```

### Verify a DynamicBrcode Read

When a DynamicBrcode is read by your user, a GET request will be made to the URL stored in the DynamicBrcode to 
retrieve additional information needed to complete the transaction.
Use this method to verify the authenticity of a GET request received at your registered endpoint.
If the provided digital signature does not check out with the Stark public key, a
StarkInfra\Exception\InvalidSignatureException will be raised.

```php
use StarkInfra\DynamicBrcode;

$request = listen();  # this is the method you made to get the read requests posted to your registered endpoint

$uuid = DynamicBrcode::verify(
    $request->content, 
    $request->headers["Digital-Signature"]
);
```

### Respond to a Due DynamicBrcode Read

When a due DynamicBrcode is read by your user, a GET request will be made to your 
registered URL to retrieve additional information needed to complete the transaction.

The GET request must be answered within 5 seconds, with an HTTP status code 200, and 
in the following format.

```php
use StarkInfra\DynamicBrcode;

$request = listen();  # this is the method you made to get the read requests posted to your registered endpoint

$uuid = DynamicBrcode::verify(
    getUuid($request->url),  # you should implement this method to extract the UUID from the request's URL
    $request->headers["Digital-Signature"]
);

$invoice = getInvoice($uuid); # you should implement this method to get information on the BR code from its uuid

sendResponse(  # you should also implement this method to respond the read request
    DynamicBrcode::responseDue([
        "version" => $invoice->version,
        "created" => $invoice->created,
        "due" => $invoice->due,
        "keyId" => $invoice->keyId,
        "status" => $invoice->status,
        "reconciliationId" => $invoice->reconciliationId,
        "amount" => $invoice->amount,
        "senderName" => $invoice->senderName,
        "receiverName" => $invoice->receiverName,
        "receiverStreetLine" => $invoice->receiverStreetLine,
        "receiverCity" => $invoice->receiverCity,
        "receiverStateCode" => $invoice->receiverStateCode,
        "receiverZipCode" => $invoice->receiverZipCode
    ]);
);
```

### Repond to an Instant DynamicBrcode read

When an instant DynamicBrcode is read by your user, a GET request containing the 
BR code's UUID will be made to your registered URL to retrieve additional information 
needed to complete the transaction.

The GET request must be answered within 5 seconds, with an HTTP status code 200, and 
in the following format.

```php
use StarkInfra\DynamicBrcode;

$request = listen();  # this is the method you made to get the read requests posted to your registered endpoint

$uuid = DynamicBrcode::verify(
    getUuid($request->url),  # you should implement this method to extract the uuid from the request's URL
    $request->headers["Digital-Signature"]
);

$invoice = getInvoice($uuid); # you should implement this method to get the information of the BR code from its uuid

sendResponse(  # you should also implement this method to respond the read request
    DynamicBrcode::responseDue([
        "version" => $invoice->version,
        "created" => $invoice->created,
        "keyId" => $invoice->keyId,
        "status" => $invoice->status,
        "reconciliationid" => $invoice->reconciliationId,
        "amount" => $invoice->amount,
        "cashierType" => $invoice->cashierType,
        "cashierBankCode" => $invoice->cashierBankCode,
        "cashAmount" => $invoice->cashAmount
    ]);
);
```

## Create BrcodePreviews
You can create BrcodePreviews to preview BR Codes before paying them.

```php
use StarkInfra\BrcodePreview;

$previews = BrcodePreview::create([
    new BrcodePreview(["id" => "00020126420014br.gov.bcb.pix0120nedstark@hotmail.com52040000530398654075000.005802BR5909Ned Stark6014Rio de Janeiro621605126674869738606304FF71"]),
    new BrcodePreview(["id" => "00020126430014br.gov.bcb.pix0121aryastark@hotmail.com5204000053039865406100.005802BR5910Arya Stark6014Rio de Janeiro6216051262678188104863042BA4"])
]);

foreach ($previews as $preview) {
    print_r($preview);
}
```

## Credit Note

## Create credit notes 
You can create a Credit Note to generate a CCB contract:

```php
use StarkInfra\CreditNote;
use StarkInfra\CreditSigner;
use StarkInfra\CreditNote\Invoice;
use StarkInfra\CreditNote\Transfer;

$notes = CreditNote::create([
    new CreditNote([
        "templateId" => "0123456789101112",
        "name" => "Jamie Lannister",
        "taxId" => "012.345.678-90",
        "nominalAmount" => 100000,
        "scheduled" => "2022-05-11",
        "payment" => new Transfer([
            "bankCode" => "00000000",
            "branchCode" => "1234",
            "accountNumber" => "129340-1",
            "taxId" => "012.345.678-90", 
            "name" => "Jamie Lannister"
        ]),
        "paymentType" => "transfer",
        "invoices" =>[
            new Invoice([
                "amount" => 120000,
                "due" => "2022-07-11",
                "fine" => 3.0,
                "interest" => 1.0
            ])
        ], 
        "signers" =>[
            new CreditSigner([
                "contact" =>  "jamie.lannister@gmail.com",
                "method" => "link",
                "name" => "Jamie Lannister",
            ])
        ],
        "rebateAmount" => 0,
        "tags" => [
            'War supply',
            'Invoice #1234'
        ],
        "externalId" => "my_unique_id",
        "streetLine1" => "Av. Paulista, 200",
        "streetLine2" => "10 andar",
        "district" => "Bela Vista",
        "city" => "Sao Paulo",
        "stateCode" => "SP",
        "zipCode" => "01310-000"
    ]);
]);

foreach($notes as $note){
    print_r($note);
}
```

**Note**: Instead of using CreditNote objects, you can also pass each element in dictionary format

## Query credit notes

You can query multiple Credit Notes according to filters.

```php
use StarkInfra\CreditNote;

$notes = CreditNote::query([
    "limit" => 10,
    "after" => "2020-04-01",
    "before" => "2020-04-30",
    "status" => "signed",
]);

foreach($notes as $note){
    print_r($note);
}
```

## Get a credit note

After its creation, information on a Credit Note may be retrieved by its id.

```php
use StarkInfra\CreditNote;

$note = CreditNote::get("5155966664310784");

print_r($note);
```

## Cancel a credit note

You can cancel a Credit Note if it has not been signed yet.

```php
use StarkInfra\CreditNote;

$note = CreditNote::cancel("5155966664310784");

print_r($note);
```

## Query credit note logs

You can query Credit Note logs to better understand credit note life cycles.

```php
use StarkInfra\CreditNote\Log;

$logs = Log::query(["limit" => 10]);

foreach($logs as $log){
    print_r($log);
}
```

## Get credit note log

You can also get a specific log by its id.

```php
use StarkInfra\CreditNote\Log;

$log = Log::get("5155966664310784");

print_r($log);
```

## Credit Preview
You can preview different types of credits before creating them (Currently we only have CreditNote previews):

### Create a CreditNotePreview
You can preview a Credit Note before the creation of the CCB contract:

```php
use StarkInfra\CreditPreview;
use StarkInfra\CreditNote\Invoice;

$previews = CreditPreview::create([
    new CreditPreview([
        "type" => "credit-note",
        "credit" => new CreditPreview\CreditNotePreview([
            "type" => "american",
            "nominalAmount" => 100000,
            "scheduled" => "2022-10-11",
            "taxId" => "012.345.678-90",
            "initialDue" => "2022-11-11",
            "nominalInterest" => 10,
            "count" => 5,
            "interval" => "month",
        ])
    ]),
    new CreditPreview([
        "type" => "credit-note",
        "credit" => new CreditPreview\CreditNotePreview([
            "initialAmount" => 2478,
            "initialDue" => "2022-10-22",
            "nominalAmount" => 90583,
            "nominalInterest" => 3.7,
            "rebateAmount" => 23,
            "scheduled" => "2022-09-28",
            "taxId" => "477.954.506-44",
            "type" => "sac"
        ])
    ]),
    new CreditPreview([
        "type" => "credit-note",
        "credit" => new CreditPreview\CreditNotePreview([
            "initialAmount" => 4449,
            "initialDue" => "2022-09-16",
            "interval" => "year",
            "nominalAmount" => 96084,

            "scheduled" => "2022-09-02",
            "taxId" => "81.882.684/0001-02",
            "type" => "price"
        ])
    ]),
    new CreditPreview([
        "type" => "credit-note",
        "credit" => new CreditPreview\CreditNotePreview([
            "count" => 8,
            "initialDue" => "2022-09-18",
            "nominalAmount" => 6161,
            "nominalInterest" => 3.2,
            "scheduled" => "2022-09-03",
            "taxId" => "59.352.830/0001-20",
            "type" => "american"
        ])
    ]),
    new CreditPreview([
        "type" => "credit-note",
        "credit" => new CreditPreview\CreditNotePreview([
            "initialDue" => "2022-09-13",
            "nominalAmount" => 86237,
            "nominalInterest" => 2.6,
            "scheduled" => "2022-09-03",
            "taxId" => "37.293.955/0001-94",
            "type" => "bullet"
        ])
    ]),
    new CreditPreview([
        "type" => "credit-note",
        "credit" => new CreditPreview\CreditNotePreview([
            "invoices" => [
                new Invoice([
                    "amount" => 14500,
                    "due" => "2022-10-19"
                ]),
                new Invoice([
                    "amount" => 14500,
                    "due" => "2022-11-25"
                ])
            ],
            "nominalAmount" => 29000,
            "rebateAmount" => 900,
            "scheduled" => "2022-09-31",
            "taxId" => "36.084.400/0001-70",
            "type" => "custom"
        ])
    ]),
]);

foreach($previews as $preview){
    print_r($preview);
}
```

**Note**: Instead of using CreditPreview objects, you can also pass each element in dictionary format

## Webhook

## Create a webhook subscription
To create a Webhook subscription and be notified whenever an event occurs, run:

```php
use StarkInfra\Webhook;

$webhooks = Webhook::create([
    new Webhook([
        "url" => "https://webhook.site/",
        "subscriptions" =>[
            "credit-note"
            "issuing-card", "issuing-invoice", "issuing-purchase",
            "pix-request.in", "pix-request.out", "pix-reversal.in", "pix-reversal.out", "pix-claim", "pix-key", "pix-infraction", "pix-chargeback"
        ]
    ]);
]);

foreach($webhooks as $webhook){
    print_r($webhook);
}
```

## Query webhooks
To search for registered Webhooks, run:

```php
use StarkInfra\Webhook;

$webhooks = Webhook::query();

foreach($webhooks as $webhook){
    print_r($webhook);
}
```

## Get a webhook
You can get a specific Webhook by its id.

```php
use StarkInfra\Webhook;

$webhooks = Webhook::get("1082736198236817");

print_r($webhook);
```

## Delete a webhook
You can also delete a specific Webhook by its id.

```php
use StarkInfra\Webhook;

$webhooks = Webhook::delete("1082736198236817");

print_r($webhook);
```

## Process Webhook events

It's easy to process events delivered to your Webhook endpoint. Remember to pass the
signature header so the SDK can make sure it was really StarkInfra that sent you
the event.

```php
use StarkInfra\Event;

$response = listen()  # this is the method you made to get the events posted to your webhook

$event = Event::parse($response->content, $response->headers["Digital-Signature"]);

if ($event->subscription == "pix-request.in"){
    print_r($event->log->request);
} elseif ($event->subscription == "pix-claim"){
    print_r($event->log->claim);
} elseif ($event->subscription == "pix-key"){
    print_r($event->log->key);
} elseif ($event->subscription == "pix-infraction"){
    print_r($event->log->infraction);
} elseif ($event->subscription == "pix-chargeback"){
    print_r($event->log->chargeback);
} elseif ($event->subscription == "pix-request.out"){
    print_r($event->log->request);
} elseif ($event->subscription == "pix-reversal.in"){
    print_r($event->log->reversal);
} elseif ($event->subscription == "pix-reversal.out"){
    print_r($event->log->reversal);
} elseif ($event->subscription == "issuing-card"){
    print_r($event->log->card);
} elseif ($event->subscription == "issuing-invoice"){
    print_r($event->log->invoice);
} elseif ($event->subscription == "issuing-purchase"){
    print_r($event->log->purchase);
} 
```

## Query webhook events

To search for webhooks events, run:

```php
use StarkInfra\Event;

$events = Event::query(["after" => "2020-03-20", "isDelivered" => false]);

foreach($events as $event){
    print_r($event);
}
```

## Get a webhook event

You can get a specific webhook event by its id.

```php
use StarkInfra\Event;

$event = Event::get("1082736198236817");

print_r($event);
```

## Delete a webhook event

You can also delete a specific webhook event by its id.

```php
use StarkInfra\Event;

$event = Event::delete("1082736198236817");

print_r($event);
```

## Set webhook events as delivered

This can be used in case you've lost events.
With this function, you can manually set events retrieved from the API as
"delivered" to help future event queries with `isDelivered=false`.

```php
use StarkInfra\Event;

$event = Event::update("1298371982371929",  true);

print_r($event);
```

## Query failed webhook event delivery attempts information

You can also get information on failed webhook event delivery attempts.

```php
use StarkInfra\Event\Attempt;

$attempts = Attempt::query(["eventIds" => $event->id, "limit" => 1]);

foreach($attempts as $attempt){
    print_r($attempt);
}
```

## Get a failed webhook event delivery attempt information

To retrieve information on a single attempt, use the following function:

```php
use StarkInfra\Event\Attempt;

$attempt = Attempt::get("1616161616161616");

print_r($attempt);
```

# Handling errors

The SDK may raise one of four types of errors: __InputErrors__, __InternalServerError__, __UnknownError__, __InvalidSignatureError__

__InputErrors__ will be raised whenever the API detects an error in your request (status code 400).
If you catch such an error, you can get its elements to verify each of the
individual errors that were detected in your request by the API.
For example:

```php
use StarkInfra;
use StarkInfra\Error\InputErrors;

try {
    $cards = StarkInfra\IssuingCard::create([
        new StarkInfra\IssuingCard([
            "holdeNname" => "Developers",
            "holderTaxId" => "012.345.678-90",
            "holderExternalId" => "1234",
            "rules" => [
                new StarkInfra\IssuingRule([
                    "name" => "general",
                    "interval" => "week",
                    "amount" => 50000,
                    "currencyCode" => "USD"
                ])
            ]
        ]),
    ]);
} catch (InputErrors $e) {
    foreach($e->errors as $error){
        echo "\n\ncode: " . $error->errorCode;
        echo "\nmessage: " . $error->errorMessage;
    }
}
```

__InternalServerError__ will be raised if the API runs into an internal error.
If you ever stumble upon this one, rest assured that the development team
is already rushing in to fix the mistake and get you back up to speed.

__UnknownError__ will be raised if a request encounters an error that is
neither __InputErrors__ nor an __InternalServerError__, such as connectivity problems.

__InvalidSignatureError__ will be raised specifically by StarkInfra\Event::parse()
when the provided content and signature do not check out with the Stark Infra public
key.
